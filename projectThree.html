                    <p>
                        This project was done at Teckplus in Nigeria. Teckplus is a young and growing tech company in Lagos that is 
                        committed to bringing about transformation through innovations and inventions. 
                        <br><br>
                        The services they offer include web development, mobile app development, cyber security, IOT and machine learning. 
                        The project is a comprehensive school management desktop application which is responsive and suitable for different screen sizes.

                <h3>Identifying the problems</h3>
                <span class="artdivider"></span>
                    <p>Initially, the first version of the app was designed to be used  internationally. However, after the deployment in a public school in Lagos,  
                    we noticed that the app was too comprehensive. Therefore, we started another version with the aim of simplifying it and removing
                        unnecessary features so that users can have better experiences.     
                         <br><br>
                        Prior to the development of the second version, we updated our design system to a modern version. So we seized the opportunity to design a new 
                        version of the app that is in compliance with our new design system. 
                         </p><br><br><br>

                <h3>Users and audience</h3>
                    <span class="artdivider"></span>
                    <p>
                    The users of the app include the  public school officials in Lagos (principals, vice-principals, teachers, district officials, state officials) and the students.  
                    Unlike the first version of the app which was designed to be used worldwide, the second version was targeted at the public 
                        schools in Lagos. <br><br>
                        These schools run  a system of management which is different from other schools in other states in Nigeria in which a district controls all the activities of the
                         schools under it. The district dictate the curriculum and also influence other vital part of the admission process.
                        
                        
                    </p><br><br><br>

        <div class="sideSpace">   
            <h3>My roles and responsibilities</h3>
                <span class="artdivider"></span>
                <p>
                     As at the time the first version of the app was designed, I was not part of the company's design team. I got employed when the designing of the second version of the app began. I had the opportunity of working with two other product designers, two front-end developers and two back-end developers.  <br><br>
                    I was responsible for designing different part of the school portal, state portal and the district portal. We had series of meetings with the frontend and backbend
                     team during which we collaborated on the the designs and how it would be implemented.
                </p>

        <div class="sideSpace">   
            <h3>Scope and constraints</h3>
                <span class="artdivider"></span>
                <p>
                
                The development of the second version of the app was smooth and easy. This is because the team had learnt different lessons from the deployment of the first version. The biggest problem we encountered in the development of the second version came during  the deployment process. Most of the schools did not have the important details needed for the deployment ready. They had to search through files and make different calls to get them which wasted the time of our team and slowed down the deployment process. <br><br>
                
                Also, some of the schools tried to claim ownership of the app by requesting that the important parts of the app only bear their logos. We dealt with this problem by clearly defining the terms and agreement guiding the usage of the app and also modified certain aspect of the app to accommodate the design needs of the schools.

                <h3>The process</h3>
                    <span class="artdivider"></span>
                    <p>
                        We started the design process by doing a qualitative research. We conducted interviews with the users at the districts to know their needs, understand 
                        their behaviors and attitudes. We created user personas and user story based on the information we gathered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We used figma for both the wireframing and prototyping of this project. We created a design system to simplify the design process and ensure 
                        consistency throughout the project. As as team, we designed the desktop, tablet and mobile views for all the portals. We had several meetings 
                        with the frontend and backend teams where we collaborated on the design and exchanged ideas.

                    The design was tested by different group of users from the district and the schools. Most of the users were able to easily navigate the app with ease.
